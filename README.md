Create a [TWRP](https://twrp.me/)-compatible device tree only from an Android recovery image (or a boot image if the device uses non-dynamic partitions A/B) of your device's stock ROM
It has been confirmed that this script supports images built starting from Android 4.4 up to Android 12

Requires Python 3.8 or greater

## Installation

```sh
pip3 install twrpdtgen
```

Linux only: Be sure to have cpio installed in your system (Install cpio using `sudo apt install cpio` or `sudo pacman -S cpio` based on what package manager you're using)

## Instructions

```sh
python3 -m twrpdtgen <path to image>
```

When an image is provided, if everything goes well, there will be a device tree at `output/manufacturer/codename`

You can also use the module in a script, with the following code:

```python
from twrpdtgen.device_tree import DeviceTree

# Get image info
device_tree = DeviceTree(image_path)

# Dump device tree to folder
device_tree.dump_to_folder(output_path)
```
